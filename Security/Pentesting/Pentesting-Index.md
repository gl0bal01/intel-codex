# Penetration Testing SOPs

This directory contains Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for penetration testing across various domains and platforms.

## Available Pentesting SOPs

### Infrastructure & Systems
- [[sop-linux-pentest|Linux Pentesting]]
- [[sop-ad-pentest|Active Directory Pentesting]]

### Applications & Development
- [[sop-web-application-security|Web Application Security]]
- [[sop-mobile-security|Mobile Security Testing]]
- [[sop-firmware-reverse-engineering|Firmware Reverse Engineering]]

### Offensive Security
- [[sop-vulnerability-research|Vulnerability Research]]
- [[sop-bug-bounty|Bug Bounty Methodology]]
- [[sop-detection-evasion-testing|Detection Evasion Testing]]

### Defensive & Forensics
- [[sop-forensics-investigation|Forensics Investigation]]

## Purpose

These SOPs provide standardized procedures for:
- Conducting security assessments and penetration tests
- Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities
- Testing security controls and defensive measures
- Researching new vulnerabilities and attack techniques

## Common Workflows

### Web Application Testing
1. [[sop-web-application-security|Web Application Security]] - OWASP Top 10
2. [[sop-bug-bounty|Bug Bounty]] - For responsible disclosure
3. [[sop-vulnerability-research|Vulnerability Research]] - For novel vulnerabilities

### Infrastructure Pentesting
1. [[sop-linux-pentest|Linux Pentesting]] - Unix/Linux systems
2. [[sop-ad-pentest|Active Directory Pentesting]] - Windows environments
3. [[sop-detection-evasion-testing|Detection Evasion]] - Bypassing defenses

### Mobile & Embedded
1. [[sop-mobile-security|Mobile Security]] - iOS/Android applications
2. [[sop-firmware-reverse-engineering|Firmware RE]] - IoT and embedded devices
3. [[sop-vulnerability-research|Vulnerability Research]] - For exploit development

### Post-Exploitation & Investigation
1. [[sop-detection-evasion-testing|Detection Evasion]] - Maintaining access
2. [[sop-forensics-investigation|Forensics Investigation]] - Evidence collection
