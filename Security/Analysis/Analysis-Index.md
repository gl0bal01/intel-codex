# Security Analysis SOPs

This directory contains Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for security analysis, reverse engineering, and cryptographic analysis.

## Available Analysis SOPs

- [[sop-malware-analysis|Malware Analysis]]
- [[sop-reverse-engineering|Reverse Engineering]]
- [[sop-cryptography-analysis|Cryptography Analysis]]
- [[sop-hash-generation-methods|Hash Generation Methods]]
- [[sop-forensics-investigation|Digital Forensics Investigation]]

## Purpose

These SOPs provide standardized procedures for:
- Analyzing malicious software and binaries
- Reverse engineering applications and protocols
- Evaluating cryptographic implementations
- Generating and verifying file hashes for integrity
- Conducting digital forensics investigations and evidence preservation
