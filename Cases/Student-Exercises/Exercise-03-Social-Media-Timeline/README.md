## üìã Scenario

**Case ID:** EXERCISE-2025-003
**Subject:** "Alex Morgan" (fictional persona for training)
**Platforms:** Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub (simulated data)
**Authorization:** Educational exercise (fictional scenario)

**Background:**
You've been asked to reconstruct a timeline of professional activities for "Alex Morgan," a fictional tech professional, based on their public social media presence. Your goal is to understand their career progression, technical skills development, and professional network through their digital footprint.

**Important:** This exercise uses **SIMULATED DATA** provided below. You will practice timeline reconstruction using fictional posts and activities.

---

## üìù Your Assignment

### Part 1: Data Collection (2-3 hours)

**Task:** Collect and organize social media posts across multiple platforms.

**Platforms to Document:**
- Twitter: @alexmorgan_tech (simulated)
- LinkedIn: Alex Morgan (simulated)
- GitHub: alexmorgan-dev (simulated)

**For Each Platform, Collect:**
- [ ] Profile information (bio, location, links)
- [ ] Account creation date
- [ ] Key posts/activities (at least 10 per platform)
- [ ] Engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments)
- [ ] Media attachments (screenshots of key images)
- [ ] Hashtags and topics
- [ ] Mentioned/tagged accounts
- [ ] Geographic indicators

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Screenshot each post/activity
- Record post date/time with timezone
- Save to `Evidence/screenshots/[platform]/`
- Log each item in collection log with hash

---

### Part 2: Timeline Reconstruction (2-3 hours)

**Task:** Create a comprehensive chronological timeline from collected data.

**Timeline Format:**

| Date | Time | Platform | Event Type | Content Summary | Source | Significance |
|------|------|----------|------------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | HH:MM TZ | Twitter | Post | [Summary] | [URL] | [Why it matters] |

**Event Categories to Track:**
- **Career Events:** Job changes, promotions, new projects
- **Skills Development:** Learning new technologies, certifications
- **Professional Network:** Conferences attended, collaborations
- **Content Creation:** Blog posts, tutorials, open source contributions
- **Personal Milestones:** (if relevant to professional context)

**Analysis Questions:**
1. What is the subject's career trajectory?
2. What technical skills have they developed over time?
3. Are there any gaps in activity? (Significant breaks?)
4. Do posts across platforms align or contradict?
5. What professional relationships are evident?

---

### Part 3: Cross-Platform Correlation (1-2 hours)

**Task:** Identify connections and verify information across platforms.

**Correlation Checks:**
- [ ] Do employment dates match across LinkedIn and Twitter?
- [ ] Do GitHub projects align with claimed skills on LinkedIn?
- [ ] Do conference mentions on Twitter match LinkedIn updates?
- [ ] Do profile pictures match across platforms? (OSINT verification)
- [ ] Do location tags align across platforms?
- [ ] Do contact details (website, email) match?

**Create Correlation Matrix:**

| Claim | LinkedIn | Twitter | GitHub | Verified? |
|-------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Works at TechCorp | ‚úì (profile) | ‚úì (bio) | ‚úì (repos) | Yes |
| Knows Python | ‚úì (skills) | ‚úì (tweets) | ‚úì (code) | Yes |
| Attended DefCon 2024 | ‚úó | ‚úì (tweet) | ‚úó | Partial |

**Confidence Assessment:**
- **High:** Verified across 3+ sources
- **Medium:** Verified across 2 sources
- **Low:** Single source, unverified

---

### Part 4: Pattern Analysis (1 hour)

**Task:** Identify behavioral patterns and anomalies.

**Patterns to Analyze:**

**Posting Behavior:**
- Peak activity times (hourly breakdown)
- Day-of-week patterns
- Frequency changes over time
- Platform preferences (which platform for what content?)

**Content Themes:**
- Primary topics/interests (quantify: X% cybersecurity, Y% programming, etc.)
- Sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
- Interaction style (questions, statements, shares?)
- Evolution of interests over time

**Network Patterns:**
- Who does the subject interact with most?
- Any notable connections to organizations/companies?
- Follower growth patterns
- Engagement rate trends

**Anomalies to Flag:**
- Sudden topic shifts
- Account inactivity periods
- Location inconsistencies
- Suspicious behavior (mass follows, bot-like posting)

## üí° Hints & Tips

**Common Challenges:**

1. **"There's too much data to organize"**
   - Start with a simple spreadsheet
   - Use markdown tables for clean formatting
   - Sort by date first, analyze later

2. **"I can't find conflicts"**
   - That's okay! Sometimes data is consistent
   - Document that you checked for conflicts
   - Note high confidence in verified facts

3. **"Creating screenshots of simulated data?"**
   - Type the simulated posts into a text document
   - Screenshot that document (as if it were real)
   - Or use mockup tools (Tweeten, etc.)
   - Focus on practicing the process, not perfect fakes

4. **"Timeline is confusing"**
   - Use timeline template provided
   - One event per row
   - Add "Significance" column to explain importance
