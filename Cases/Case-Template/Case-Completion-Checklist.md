## ðŸš¨ Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Impact | Prevention |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **Missing evidence hashes** | Evidence inadmissible | Hash immediately after collection |
| **Incomplete collection log** | Can't trace evidence origin | Log as you go, not at the end |
| **No authorization documented** | Legal liability | Get written authorization BEFORE starting |
| **Poor OPSEC** | Tipped off subject | Follow OPSEC plan throughout |
| **Single-source verification** | False conclusions | Always cross-reference multiple sources |
| **Skipping chain of custody** | Evidence contamination concerns | Document every transfer/access |
