## Analysis & Findings

### Social Media Analysis

**Twitter/X Account (@crypto_scammer_example):**
- **Account Age:** 48 days (suspiciously recent)
- **Follower Analysis:**
  - 1,247 followers
  - 73% appear to be bot accounts (based on profile analysis)
  - Purchased followers likely from SMM panel
- **Tweet Patterns:**
  - Retweets legitimate crypto news (appears normal)
  - DMs sent to followers of @RealCryptoGuru (targeted approach)
  - No original content (all stolen from legitimate account)

**Cross-Platform Presence:**
- Telegram account created same day as Twitter (coordinated)
- Instagram account used same stolen profile picture
- Consistent handle pattern: "crypto_alex" / "alex.crypto"

### Domain/Infrastructure Analysis

**Primary Phishing Domain:**
```
Domain: crypto-presale-exclusive[.]com
Registered: 2024-12-15
Registrar: Namecheap
Registrant Email: alex.crypto.trades@protonmail.com
IP Address: 185.220.101.42 (Hosting: Cloudflare)
SSL Certificate: Let's Encrypt (free)
```

**Website Analysis:**
- Near-perfect clone of legitimate exchange
- Fake "KYC verification" form (data harvesting)
- Fake crypto wallet addresses for deposits
- No actual trading functionality (pure scam)

**Network Infrastructure:**
- Used Cloudflare CDN to hide origin server
- Email communications through ProtonMail (anonymous)
- Payment address changes per victim (laundering technique)

### Financial Analysis

**Blockchain Investigation (Ethereum):**

**Primary Wallet:** 0x1234...abcd (example address)
- **Inbound Transactions:** 52 deposits
- **Total Received:** ~87.3 ETH (~$150,000 USD at time)
- **Outbound Transactions:** Funds moved through mixer (Tornado Cash)

**Victim Deposits (Examples):**
```
Tx Hash: 0xabc123... | Amount: 2.5 ETH | Date: 2024-12-20
Tx Hash: 0xdef456... | Amount: 1.8 ETH | Date: 2024-12-22
Tx Hash: 0x789ghi... | Amount: 3.2 ETH | Date: 2024-12-28
```

**Money Laundering Pattern:**
1. Victim deposits to wallet A
2. Funds immediately forwarded to wallet B
3. Wallet B sends to Tornado Cash (mixer)
4. Funds emerge from mixer to exchanges (cashout)

### Attribution Indicators

**Language Analysis:**
- Profile bio contains British English spelling ("analyse", "favour")
- DM messages show inconsistent grammar (likely non-native speaker)
- Timezone analysis: Most active 14:00-22:00 UTC+3 (Eastern Europe likely)

**Technical Indicators:**
- Domain registered with privacy protection
- Uses VPN/Tor for anonymity
- ProtonMail for email (privacy-focused)
- Cryptocurrency payments only (no traceable fiat)

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- Targets specific demographic (crypto investors, age 25-45)
- Uses urgency tactics ("limited spots", "closing soon")
- Builds trust through fake verification badges
- Mimics legitimate influencer's communication style

**Ongoing Risks:**
- Additional accounts may exist (suspect likely operating multiple personas)
