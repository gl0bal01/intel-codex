### Behavioral Analysis

#### Modus Operandi

**Impersonation Strategy:**
1. Create accounts mimicking verified influencer
2. Steal profile picture and bio
3. Purchase bot followers to appear legitimate
4. Target followers of real influencer

**Victim Targeting:**
1. Identify users engaging with crypto content
2. Send personalized DM claiming "exclusive opportunity"
3. Create urgency ("limited spots", "ending soon")
4. Direct to phishing website

**Phishing Website Tactics:**
1. Clone legitimate exchange interface
2. Request "KYC verification" (data harvesting)
3. Display fake wallet address for deposits
4. No actual trading functionality
5. Funds immediately forwarded to launder

**Money Laundering:**
1. Receive victim deposits to Wallet A
2. Forward to Wallet B within minutes
3. Send through Tornado Cash mixer
4. Withdraw to exchanges (likely for cashout)

---

### Attribution Assessment

**Confidence Level:** Low-Medium

**Indicators:**

- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Ukraine (timezone match, tech skills)
- ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´ Romania (timezone match, cybercrime hub)
- ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ Bulgaria (timezone match)

**Assessment:**
Cannot definitively attribute to specific individual or location without:
- Law enforcement access to ProtonMail records
- Tor network analysis (requires ISP/Tor cooperation)
- Exchange KYC data (requires subpoena)
- Mistake by subject (operational security slip)

---

### Threat Assessment

**Recidivism Risk:** ðŸ”´ High

**Likelihood of Continued Activity:**
- Subject likely operates multiple personas simultaneously

- Low detection risk (using anonymity tools)

---

### Investigation Gaps

**Unknown Information:**

**Investigative Limitations:**
- ProtonMail won't disclose user info without legal process

## Reference Example: Organization Profiling

### Related Entity - "CryptoVault Solutions LLC"

**Note:** This is an additional example showing how to profile an **organization entity** (not directly related to the Alex Morgan scam case above).

**Entity Type:** Organization (Offshore Company)
**Primary Use:** Demonstrates organization profiling methodology

For the complete organization dossier example, see:
- Full methodology: [[../../Investigations/Techniques/sop-entity-dossier|Entity Dossier SOP]]
- Organization structure includes: Corporate registry searches, beneficial ownership, regulatory status, financial indicators, blockchain wallets (if crypto-related), court records, media coverage

**Key Differences from Person Profiling:**
- Focus on corporate structure, not demographics
- Regulatory compliance vs. personal behavior
- Beneficial owners vs. personal associates
- Financial statements vs. income sources
- Business operations vs. lifestyle patterns

**Where to find example:**
For a fully-worked organization profile example with all sections completed, refer to the Entity Dossier SOP which contains comprehensive templates for both person and organization entities.
