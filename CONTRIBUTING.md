# Contributing to Intel Codex

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Intel Codex** — a knowledge‑base covering OSINT, reverse engineering, malware analysis, cryptography and intelligence frameworks for security researchers.  

We welcome contributions of all kinds: new SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures), improvements to existing content, bug‑fixes in markup or links, structural/navigation updates, etc.

## ✅ How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gl0bal01/intel-codex.git
   ```
2. Create a new branch for your work:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-topic
   ```
3. Make your changes (see “Style & Structure” below).
4. Update the navigation index (`START.md`) if you add or change content.
5. Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
6. Push your branch to your fork and open a Pull Request (PR) against `main`.

## 📁 Style & Structure

To keep the vault consistent and easy to navigate, please follow the naming and formatting conventions below:

### File naming
- For new SOPs under **Investigations** or **Security**: `sop-<topic>.md`
- For platform-specific guides: `sop-platform-<name>.md`
- E.g.: `sop-twitter-x-investigation.md`, `sop-reverse-shell-analysis.md`

### Folder structure  
```
ObsidianVault/
├── START.md                       # Start here – main navigation hub  
├── Investigations/                # OSINT techniques & platform guides
│   ├── Platforms/                 # Platform-specific SOPs (Twitter, Telegram, Instagram, etc.)
│   └── Techniques/                # Investigation methods (OPSEC, legal/ethics, image-analysis, etc.)  
├── Security/                      # Malware analysis & pentesting
│   ├── Analysis/                  # Malware, reverse-engineering, cryptography
│   └── Pentesting/                # Web, mobile, AD, vulnerability research
└── Cases/                         # Investigation management & examples
    ├── Case-Template/            # Blank case structure for new investigations
    └── 2025-001-Example-Investigation/  # Complete case example  
```

### Content requirements  
- Start your SOP with a clear title and summary of what the SOP covers.  
- Provide copy‑paste ready commands for Windows/Linux/macOS where applicable.  
- Link to any relevant other SOPs or resources inside the vault for cross‑reference.  
- Include a section at the bottom discussing **Legal & Ethics** (with any relevant disclaimers) if your SOP involves investigations, OSINT, or adversary tactics.  
- Ensure links and internal references are working, and that markdown formatting is consistent.

## 🔍 Review Process

When you submit your PR, it will be reviewed by a maintainer. The review may include:

- Checking markup/layout consistency  
- Verifying that new additions follow the naming/structural conventions  
- Ensuring content is accurate, clear, and properly referenced  
- Confirming that any added dependencies (e.g., external tools or links) are valid and appropriate for this knowledge base  

Please respond to review comments promptly so we can merge your contribution quickly.
