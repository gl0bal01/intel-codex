# CTF Getting Started Guide

## What is CTF?

**Capture The Flag (CTF)** is a cybersecurity competition where participants solve security-related challenges to find hidden "flags" (usually text strings in a specific format like `flag{this_is_a_flag}`).

### Types of CTF Events
1. **Jeopardy Style**: Individual challenges in different categories
2. **Attack-Defense**: Teams attack each other's systems while defending their own
3. **King of the Hill**: Compete for control of a shared system

## Common Categories

### üîê Cryptography
- **Description**: Decrypt ciphers, break encryption, analyze cryptographic protocols
- **Common Challenges**: Caesar cipher, RSA, AES, hash functions
- **Skills Needed**: Mathematics, pattern recognition, cryptographic theory

### üåê Web Exploitation
- **Description**: Find vulnerabilities in web applications
- **Common Challenges**: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, directory traversal
- **Skills Needed**: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, HTTP protocols, web security

### üíæ Binary Exploitation / Pwn
- **Description**: Exploit vulnerabilities in compiled programs
- **Common Challenges**: Buffer overflows, format string bugs, ROP chains, stack/heap overflows
- **Skills Needed**: Assembly language, debugging, memory management

### üïµÔ∏è Reverse Engineering
- **Description**: Analyze programs to understand their functionality
- **Common Challenges**: Decompiling, anti-debugging, obfuscation
- **Skills Needed**: Assembly language, debuggers, static analysis

### üîç Forensics
- **Description**: Analyze digital evidence and recover hidden data
- **Common Challenges**: File recovery, steganography, memory dumps, PCAP analysis
- **Skills Needed**: File formats, hex analysis, data recovery

### üîß Misc
- **Description**: Challenges that don't fit other categories
- **Examples**: OSINT, programming puzzles, steganography, network analysis

## Quick Start Steps

### 1. Setup Your Environment
- **VM**: Ubuntu/Debian + Exegol, Kali Linux, Parrot Security
- **Essential Tools**: See [CTF_Tools](CTF_Tools.md)

### 2. Learn the Basics
- Understand common file types and encodings
- Learn basic command-line tools (cat, grep, strings, file)
- Practice with hex editors and network tools
- Study basic cryptography and web security

### 3. General Methodology
See [[CTF_Challenge_Methodology]] for detailed approach.

**Basic workflow**:
1. Read the challenge description carefully
2. Download and examine all provided files
3. Identify the category and likely vulnerability
4. Research relevant techniques and tools
5. Try common exploits and encodings
6. Document your process
7. Submit the flag

### 4. Team Coordination (Optional)
If competing with a team, see [[CTF_Team_Coordination]] for:
- Role assignments and communication setup
- Challenge tracking and time management
- Crisis protocols and collaboration templates

### 5. Document Your Work
- Keep detailed notes of what you tried
- Screenshot important findings
- Write writeups after solving challenges
- See [[Writeups/Writeups-Index|Writeups Index]] for structure

## Essential Skills to Develop

### Technical
- Command-line proficiency (Linux/Windows)
- Programming (Python, C, JavaScript)
- Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS)
- Assembly language basics (x86, ARM)
- Web technologies (HTML, SQL, JavaScript)

### Problem-Solving
- Pattern recognition
- Lateral thinking
- Persistence and patience
- Research skills
- Trial and error mindset

## Common Beginner Mistakes

- ‚ùå **Giving up too quickly** - Many challenges require persistence
- ‚ùå **Not reading the description** - Often contains critical hints
- ‚ùå **Ignoring file metadata** - Run `file`, `strings`, `exiftool` on everything
- ‚ùå **Skipping documentation** - Write notes even when you fail
- ‚ùå **Working in isolation** - Join communities, ask for hints (not solutions)
