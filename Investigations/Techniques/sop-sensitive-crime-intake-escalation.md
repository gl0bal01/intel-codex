## Overview

### When to Use This SOP

**Immediate escalation required for:**
- **Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)** or child exploitation
- **Imminent threat to life** (suicide, violence, kidnapping)
- **Terrorism or national security threats** (attack planning, extremist recruitment)
- **Human trafficking indicators** (forced labor, sex trafficking)
- **Active violent crime** (ongoing assault, active shooter)
- **Mass casualty planning** (bombings, chemical attacks)

**This SOP does NOT apply to:**
- Standard criminal activity (fraud, theft, drug sales) - continue normal investigation
- Historical crimes with no ongoing threat - document and report through normal channels
- Regulatory violations or civil matters - handle per organizational policy

### Legal Framework

**Mandatory Reporting Laws:**
- **United States:** Federal law (18 U.S.C. § 2258A) requires reporting CSAM to NCMEC
- **European Union:** GDPR Article 6(1)(d) permits processing for vital interests (life-threatening situations)
- **United Kingdom:** Section 47 Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires reporting trafficking
- **Australia:** Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995 (Division 474.22) CSAM reporting

**Good Samaritan Provisions:**
- Reporting in good faith generally protected from liability
- Privilege applies to mandatory reporters (varies by jurisdiction)
- No duty to investigate beyond reasonable belief

### Investigator Responsibilities

**You MUST:**
- Stop active collection immediately upon discovering sensitive content
- Escalate to appropriate authority within required timeframe (often <24 hours)
- Preserve minimal evidence necessary for law enforcement action
- Protect your own psychological safety (secondary trauma risk)
- Document all actions taken during incident

**You MUST NOT:**
- Download, view, or store illegal content (especially CSAM)
- Continue investigation without law enforcement guidance
- Share sensitive content with unauthorized persons
- Delete evidence before law enforcement takes custody
- Attempt to contact suspects or victims directly

## Golden Rules

### Rule 1: DO NOT Possess Illegal Content

**CSAM and Contraband:**
- **NEVER download** CSAM images or videos to your device
- **NEVER view** CSAM content beyond what's necessary to identify it
- **NEVER create copies** of illegal material (even for evidence purposes)
- **Legal risk:** Possession is a felony (US: 18 U.S.C. § 2252, UK: Protection of Children Act 1978)

**What you CAN collect:**
- URL/link to illegal content (do not click)
- Screenshot of file listing or thumbnail (if no explicit content visible)
- Metadata (filename, file size, hash, upload date)
- Account information (username, profile, timestamps)
- Text of conversations (grooming, planning, coordination)

**Example:**
```text
✅ ALLOWED:
- URL: https://example.com/file/abc123.jpg (DO NOT OPEN)
- Filename: "IMG_2024_child.jpg"
- SHA-256: a1b2c3d4e5f6... (if already computed by platform)
- Account: @suspicious_user_123

❌ PROHIBITED:
- Downloading file to local disk
- Opening file to view content
- Taking screenshots of explicit imagery
- Sharing file with colleagues
```

### Rule 2: Prioritize Life Safety

**Imminent Harm Protocol:**
- If you believe someone is in **immediate danger**, call emergency services (911, 999, 112) FIRST
- Provide dispatcher with:
  - Type of emergency (medical, violence, kidnapping)
  - Location (physical address if known, or last known location)
  - Description of victim and suspect (if applicable)
  - Your contact information
- Then escalate internally per organizational policy

**What constitutes "imminent"?**
- Specific threat with timeline (e.g., "tonight at 10 PM")
- Ongoing violence or medical emergency
- Credible suicide threat with means (e.g., "I have a gun, I'm going to end it")
- Real-time tracking of victim in danger

**What does NOT require immediate 911 call:**
- Historical events (abuse that occurred in the past)
- General threats without specific timeline or target
- Suicidal ideation without plan or means
- Suspected trafficking without immediate harm

### Rule 3: Stop Standard Collection

**When escalation triggers are met:**
1. **STOP** all active collection activities immediately
2. **DO NOT** continue investigating the sensitive matter
3. **DO NOT** attempt to gather more evidence (law enforcement role)
4. **DO NOT** engage with suspects or victims
5. **Record** only minimal identifiers (URLs, usernames, timestamps)

**Why stop?**
- Legal risk: Exceeding authorized scope, possessing illegal content
- Evidentiary risk: Chain of custody issues, admissibility concerns
- Safety risk: Alerting suspects, endangering victims
- Psychological risk: Secondary trauma from prolonged exposure

**What to do instead:**
- Preserve evidence you've already lawfully collected
- Document your findings in escalation report
- Transfer responsibility to law enforcement
- Wait for law enforcement guidance before resuming

### Rule 4: Document Everything

**Required documentation:**
- Date/time of discovery (UTC + local timezone)
- What you found (description without illegal content)
- Where you found it (URL, platform, account)
- What actions you took (preserved, escalated, stopped)
- Who you escalated to (name, agency, contact info, reference number)
- Any law enforcement instructions received

**Use Escalation Report Template (see below)**

### Rule 5: Protect Yourself

**Secondary Trauma Risk:**
- Viewing traumatic content (CSAM, violence, terrorism) causes psychological harm
- Symptoms: intrusive thoughts, nightmares, anxiety, emotional numbness
- Effects can be delayed (hours, days, weeks after exposure)

**Immediate Self-Care:**
- Stop viewing traumatic content immediately
- Take a break (walk, fresh air, talk to colleague)
- Notify supervisor of exposure
- Access Employee Assistance Program (EAP) or mental health resources

**Organizational Support:**
- Mandatory debriefing after CSAM or violent content exposure
- Access to licensed counselor/therapist
- Rotation out of sensitive investigations (if needed)
- Peer support groups for OSINT analysts

---

## Immediate Response Procedures

### Step 1: Recognize & Stop (0-5 Minutes)

**Recognize escalation trigger:**
- Immediately identify content type (CSAM, terrorism, trafficking, etc.)
- Assess imminence of threat (active danger vs. historical event)
- Determine appropriate escalation tier (Tier 1/2/3)

**Stop collection:**
- Close browser tabs or applications displaying sensitive content
- Do NOT download, screenshot, or save illegal material
- Pause automated collection scripts or tools
- Step away from workstation if needed for psychological safety

**Secure workstation:**
- Lock screen to prevent unauthorized viewing
- Ensure no sensitive content visible to others
- If working remotely, ensure privacy (no family members nearby)

### Step 2: Initial Notification (5-15 Minutes)

**Notify supervisor immediately:**
```text
Subject: URGENT - Escalation Required - [Case ID]

Supervisor,

I have encountered [CSAM / terrorism threat / human trafficking / imminent danger] during investigation of [brief case description].

Imminent threat assessment: [YES - life in danger / NO - historical or non-imminent]

I have stopped collection and am standing by for escalation guidance.

Case ID: [ID]
Discovery time: [UTC timestamp]
Platform/location: [URL or platform name - DO NOT include illegal links]

Awaiting instructions.

[Your Name]
[Contact: phone/email]
```

**If imminent threat:**
- Call supervisor immediately (do not rely on email)
- If supervisor unavailable, escalate to next in chain of command
- If imminent life threat, call 911/999/112 FIRST, then notify supervisor

### Step 3: Preserve Minimal Evidence (15-30 Minutes)

**What to preserve:**

**For CSAM:**
```text
Platform: [e.g., Telegram, forum, file host]
Account/Username: [suspect account]
URL (DO NOT OPEN): [paste URL without clicking]

| 2025-10-05 14:45 | Escalated to NCMEC | [Your Name] | Reported via CyberTipline, Ref: 123456789 |
| 2025-10-05 15:00 | Evidence secured | [Your Name] | Files moved to encrypted storage, access restricted |
| 2025-10-06 10:00 | Transferred to FBI | FBI SA John Doe | Evidence transferred via secure portal, Case: 2025-FBI-1234 |
```

### Secure Storage

**Before law enforcement takes custody:**

```bash
# Create encrypted evidence container
# Windows (BitLocker):
manage-bde -on E:\Evidence\ESC-2025-1005-001 -RecoveryPassword

# Linux (LUKS):
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb1
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb1 evidence_esc_001
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/evidence_esc_001
mount /dev/mapper/evidence_esc_001 /mnt/evidence

# Create evidence directory structure:
/Evidence/ESC-2025-1005-001/
├── metadata/          (account info, URLs, text logs)
├── screenshots/       (text conversations, profiles)
├── archives/          (web archives, saved pages)
├── chain_of_custody.md
└── SHA256SUMS         (hash verification file)

# Calculate hashes:
sha256sum -b * > SHA256SUMS
```

**Access control:**
- Restrict access to case investigator and supervisor only
- Log all access attempts
- Ensure backups are encrypted
- Never transmit via unencrypted email or cloud storage
