## Content Philosophy

Intel Codex follows these principles:

- **Practical over theoretical**: Every SOP is based on real-world operations
- **Legal and ethical first**: All techniques emphasize compliance and responsible use
- **OPSEC by default**: Operational security considerations in every procedure
- **Living documentation**: Regular updates based on field experience
- **Template-driven**: Reusable templates for consistent documentation
